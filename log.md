# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 68 - 69, March 10 + 11, 2019

**Progress**
The past two days, I've just practiced getting more comfortable with the command line.  I'm also working my way through 'Learn Ruby the Hard Way.'  It's definitely way too easy for me now (at least the first bit), but I'm happy to review to make sure all of my fundamental concepts are in place.  I did need some help solidifying my concept of the % modulus operator, for example.

### Days 65 - 67, March 7 - 9, 2019

**Progress**
Time has flown by again, and I've forgotten to commit my 100-days-of-code log again!  During the last few days, I touched up my final project and had my 1st project review, worked on the project for my interview, and today I added a feature to present at my next code review.

**Thoughts**
It's exciting digging in a little more and becoming more comfortable with React.  After I (finally) graduate, I'd like to work on some purely React or React/Redux projects so I become even more comfortable with the framework.

### Day 64 - March 6, 2019

**Progress**
I'm experimenting with reworking my project to get the delete and edit actions to work.

**Thoughts**
Scary reworking the project so much, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

### Day 62 + 63 - March 4-5, 2019

**Progress**
I just spent some time adding finishing touches to my project before my review.

**Thoughts**
I figured out that I can use Rails model validations with React (although I'm not sure how to show error messages yet).  I got my delete button to work but for some reason the page isn't rerendering after.

### Day 61 - March 3, 2019

**Progress**
Today I am simply reviewing React and Redux to make sure I completely understand how the flow of data and how the two libraries work together.

**Thoughts**
While React makes developing a frontend relatively straightforward, I want to get to know exactly how data flows for debugging purposes.  I'm also hoping it will help me figure out how to get my 'delete button' working in my portfolio project.

### Day 60 - March 2, 2019

**Progress**
Big big progress today...I COMPLETED MY FINAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT!

**Thoughts** 
I can't believe I'm finally here!  I do have a few tweaks I'd like to make, but the project works and meets project requirements.  Heck yes!

### Days 56 - 59: February 26 - March 1, 2019

**Progress**
Time really got away from me!  I hadn't realized that I didn't post since Monday during this whirlwind week.  But I did make great progress, and got more than an hour of coding in every day.  I finished my project for the interview I had on Wednesday, and then really started hammering away at my final project again.

**Thoughts** 
With the interview behind me, I could jump full-force back into my final project.  I spent along time coding along with some tutorials, and that helped my understanding of how to transition into using Redux and Thunk a lot.  My project is almost totally functional, I just need to add a show route and figure out how to separate what I'm showing in my index vs show page, and then add some more styling.

### Day 55: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Added another controller and solidified some associations in my interview project. I also added a lot of styling with Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** 
It's amazing how easy it is to use Bootstrap!  I wish I would have allowed myself to dig into it more when I first started.  But now I feel more confident creating a CRUD Rails/Bootstrap/PostgreSQL app quickly, so that's cool.

Not going to provide explicitly, but you can see on my Github :)

### Day 54: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Worked out routes and customer and project controller logic and views.

**Thoughts** 
Whoops, forgot to post again.  Lots of good progress with getting things up and running with my interview project today.

### Day 53: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Today was all about preparation for an interview next Wednesday.  I created a new Rails app, contructed the db, models, associations, user auth, application layout, etc.  A very productive day.

**Thoughts** 
It was fun circling back to Bootstrap and not being so scared about it this time.  I'm excited to work with it and understand it on a deeper level.

### Day 52: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Continued to sketch out my Api v2, and seeded the database.  I also started to plan for a technical interview I have next Wednesday.

**Thoughts** 
Lots of exciting progress today!  One victory was FINALLY figuring out how to add a Date to seed data and add it to the database properly.

### Day 51: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Figured out how to use PostgreSQL with Rails, and created the structure for Final Project, take 2.

**Thoughts** 
Yesterday was pretty harrowing, but it felt really good to have a fresh start and set up my project the right way.  I'm also super excited because I've learned how to use PostGreSQL!  This time around, I have a much clearer vision with how to build out my project step by step, and I'm very excited to see it to completion and meet project requirements.

### Day 50: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**
I did a lot of screwing around with my project...

**Thoughts** 
So yeah.  I've done a lot of reworking with my project, but basically, what I'm realizing is that I am in way over my head by using CSV data and trying to throw on a Rails model to it to meet project requirements.  And I've been watching so many tutorials to get it working right that now my code has gotten pretty screwed up.  So I'm thinking...I may just jump ship and start a fresh project that is more approachable, now that I understand the project paramters more fully.

It sucks feeling like I failed, but I'm not really sad about it at all because I learned A TON along the way.  And it's something I can return to after the pressures of completing graduation in a timely manner are off.  With a less crazy project, I can focus on making something that works and that looks nice. Onwards and upwards.

**Link(s) to work**
Heh...I didn't even bother pushing it up since I fudged things up so bad!

### Day 49: February 19, 2019
**Today's Progress**
I did a lottt of things to refactor how my client side was working in my React app.

**Thoughts** 
A lot of good progress today, and really fleshing out each container and component.  I also made sure I had redux and thunk installed and integrated.  But now my API fetch function isn't working...sigh.  I'll have to figure it out tomorrow.

https://github.com/vickicello/world-happiness-app-client

### Day 48: February 18, 2019
**Today's Progress**
I spent some more time fleshing out my React app, and doing some nicer table styling on my root page.

**Thoughts** 
 I'll need to figure out how to lay out index.js, App,js, and maybe Countries.js in a way that promotes SOC and aligns with React conventions tomorrow.  After that, I can add my router and figure out how to incorporate Redux.  Following that, how to display a Country#show page.

### Day 46 + 47: February 16-17, 2019

**Today's Progress**
Another 2 day stint.  This time, I spent a verrrry long time researching how to add associations/nested routes via React. But in reality, I pretty much ended up back at square one.  Oof.

**Thoughts** 
 I toyed around with using ActiveModelSerializers for a few hours.  And adding an image url to the countries from the CSV.  But nothing seemed to want to take.  This has been probably one of many frustrating weekends I will face as a developer - spending hours combing through tutorials and Medium posts to try to figure out how to do what I want to do.  But I think for now, as I have continued to do in the past, I must focus on just making a minimum viable app to pass project requirements.  Tomorrow I'm going to try to figure out more of the React side and perhaps experiment with using jbuilder instead of AMS, since it was giving me headaches.  Or I will leave out my associations for now and just get the basics working before adding that layer.

### Day 44 + 45: February 14-15, 2019

**Today's Progress**
I was bad and forgot to push my work up yesterday!  I got my Rails backend to connect to my React frontend though, woo!

**Thoughts** 
Lots of progress on my project the last two days, woo!

https://github.com/vickicello/world-happiness-app-api

### Day 43: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**
I set up my Rails db from an imported csv file, and fleshed out a plan for my final project.

**Thoughts** 
It was really exciting figuring out how to import csv all by myself, and also confirming that my project idea was solid.  I'm excited!

### Day 39, 40, 41, 42: February 9-12

**Today's Progress**
Whoopsies!  I was bad again about documenting my programming activity.  But I did meet my 1 hour goal each day.

**Thoughts** 
I'll try to get back on the posting-every-day-train starting tomorrow, especially since I will be in project mode!

**Today's Progress**
So I've been bad about posting lately...it's been a busy week!  I have been coding every day, but all in practice for a technical interview next Monday.

**Thoughts** 
Scramble mode!

### Day 27: January 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**
Mostly practiced algorithms and interview questions, and I worked my way through a few lessons and one lab in Learn.

**Thoughts** 
Today I spent some time on HackerRank; I think I will spend more time there because I like the flow and layout of questions more.  23 lessons and 18 labs left on Learn - holy moly!

### Day 24: January 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Made it through the Advanced Components section of React.  Created a plan of attack for nailing my first technical interview (less than 3 weeks away).  

**Thoughts** 
I've decided in addition to my Learn.co coursework, I'll switch to doing codewars exercises - 2-3 a day, for at least an hour a day.  I've decided to perform my technical interview in Ruby, so shifting the focus back to my 'native language' will be a good idea.  I'll try to work on some JS exercises as well, but hopefully I will keep up to snuff with it through my work on React.

This is probably the most stressed out I've ever been...but I think making a plan of attack and practicing algorithms & studying up every day can help me push through.  Challenge accepted!

### Day 23: January 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Finished up my last work on the fourth portfolio project.

**Thoughts** 
I'm feeling excited and also nervous - I'm kind of at that point in my development as a programmer where I 'know enough to be dangerous' - but I continue to realize there is so, so much more to learn.  I think it's all a matter of mindset - I love learning, and making things work - so I can make it happen.  I just need to keep my chin up and keep absorbing and practicing.

### Day 22: January 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Today was spent entirely on reviewing jQuery and AJAX, and figuring out a solution to the JS exercise from yesterday.  I was able to find the solution!

**Thoughts** 
After the euphoria of finally making it work, I took some time to write down and explain my process in my notes so that I really understood what was happening in the code every step of the way.  Today was also exciting because I had my first interview for a software development job, and I did pretty well.  Lots of emotional ups and downs today, but I feel a lot better after accomplishing everything that I set out to do.

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/vickicello/rails_js_us_hikes_app/tree/js_review

### Day 21: January 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Worked on finding a solution to the new JS problem I received from my project reviewer in my JS + Rails project. 

**Thoughts** 
I spent a lot of time looking over review materials from my project reviewer, and got cracking on coding my solution to the new exercise he gave me.  I was a little bit panicked because the exercise involved using a search bar or drop-down menu to search for hikes by state.  I had incorporated a drop-down menu into my project before, but I figured that a simple input field would make the input more straightforward to grab, since I had learned how to do that in past study sessions.  

This led to some intense searching of how to create a search bar in Rails, and I spent a lot of time on the aspect of the exercise that wasn't even the main focus...lots of time trying to figure out how I should manipulate the index view, controller action, models, routes, etc.  I ended up not even figuring out a solid solution, but at least I got the research underway and have a few good ideas about how I will do it.

### Day 20: January 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**
Worked on the JS assessment, and completed 5 labs, 4 lessons, 3 lessons on career development; studied up on JS core concepts, and practiced for a phone interview Wednesday.  

**Thoughts** 
It was nice to have a slower weekend (while still meeting the 1 hour of code challenge and doing some not-in-the-editor studying).  Today I was ready to jump back in though, and I was very productive.

**Today's Progress**
Worked on the JS assessment.

**Thoughts** 
Forgot to post yesterday, I just worked on some more JS fundamentals.

### Day 18: January 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I found some great resources for practicing basic JS problems, so I worked on various JS array problems.

**Thoughts** 
After feeling pretty bad about my progress yesterday, I decided to hold off on coding until later in the evening and spend some time out of the house and away from the computer, which was hard because I usually like to start coding right when I wake up on my off days in order to feel accomplished.  But I think spending some time away was needed, and I was able to recompose myself and seek out some good resources that will help me fill in the skill gap I have with JS.  I'm going to try to spend an hour a day at least on these problems until I feel more comfortable with the basics - I just need to make sure I make time to continue the Flatiron curriculum as well.

https://github.com/vickicello/js-assessment

### Day 17: January 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**
After review of my project, my coach recommended I spend more time on JS basics.  I did do a lot of live coding, which was helpful, but made me realize how much I need to practice basic vanilla js.

**Thoughts** 
Today was a little disheartening.  I am trying to remind myself that I am still a beginner, and need to just keep plugging away and coding as much as possible so I feel more comfortable in JS land.

### Day 16: January 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I tweaked my project a little bit in the Ruby stack, allowing for conditional content if a user didn't have any hikes or if there were no comments on a hike.  I also did a little bit of refactoring after my project review.

**Thoughts** 
Working out the solution that my project reviewer gave me is proving tricky, but I'll just have to keep at it.

### Day 15: January 16, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**
Completed 5 labs.

**Thoughts** 
I progressed through more of the React labs today, and had my first meeting with my career coach.  I will probably do some more work later but wanted to commit just in case I didn't get to it.

### Day 13: January 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**
An awesome day...I finally figured out the last piece to my portfolio project puzzle!!  Basically the problem was figuring out how to click a link on an element that was just rendered to the page via AJAX.  But I did it!

**Thoughts** 
It feels nice to finally wrap up this project!  Tomorrow I will record my walkthrough and submit the project.  I also had my last meeting with my educational coach, which was sad but exciting at the same time, as it means I'm almost near the end of my curriculum!

### Day 12: January 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I plowed through 7 React labs today, learning about props, state, and React components.

**Thoughts** 
It felt good to learn new things again, after the stalled feeling of working on my project.  I will definitely jump back on my project tomorrow, but for now it feels good to keep moving forward.

### Day 11: January 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I got started on the React curriulum. I practiced setting up a package.json file, and installing an npm package or two and using their functionality to write new code.  I also read a lot about the principles of React and completed the first real React lab.

**Thoughts** 
I'm thinking I need a bit of outside help for my portfolio project, so I figured I'd start on the React curriculum today and come back to the project tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 10: January 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Today I got my Comment class working, and was able to successfully render comments using AJAX, as well as submit the form via AJAX.

**Thoughts** 
Another complicated day working on my project - I got some things to work and more requirements are satisfied, but still can't manage to get my hike show AJAX method to work.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my main.css file wouldn't load, either (I still can't figure it out!)  I might have to wait until next week to get some 1:1 help with these things since they seem to be rather specific to my project.

### Day 9: January 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Thought I would finish up the project today, but ended up not being able to solve the show details of hike feature...I definitely spent more than a few hours tinkering so I think I should try again with fresh eyes tomorrow.

**Thoughts** 
Sometimes a break is needed ... otherwise I am just going in circles...and sometimes there will be code obstacles that take more than a day to fix.

### Day 8: January 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Very good day, received form data through AJAX and display via AJAX (although a bit buggy still), and also got prototype function to work on my users show page.

**Thoughts** 
Thanks to a nice study session I was able to finally get my prototype function to work, and finally solidified how I will satisfy all project requirements.

### Day 7: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I finally figured out a workaround for making a link_to my comments partial (I just turned the comments into index.html.erb which is kind of cheating, but whatever!) and got some stuff appended to the hike show page.  I am sooo close to getting that feature to work.

**Thoughts** 
I made a dumb mistake that wouldn't allow my link helper to work (forgot to put in some text as a placeholder and a comma after that text)...it was nice to be able to eventually troubleshoot the problem myself without asking anybody or googling around, although it was a silly mistake!

### Day 6: January 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: did a lot of tinkering with hike next button, but in the end decided to knix in lieu of a more approachable option (just rendering comments).  I think I figured out how to render the comments form, either via partial or by creating a form in JS

**Thoughts** 
After a lot of internal debate, I decided to knix the 'next' button on my hike show page, it was too tricky for now.  Instead I will just focus on rendering comments and the comments form.

### Day 5: January 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I GOT MY AJAX GET REQUESTS TO WORK, VIA HTML AND JSON!!!

**Thoughts** 
Again, a lot of troubleshooting today.  Takeaways: make sure you wrap your document.ready function around the entire js file; make sure you follow formatting conventions; code things out the low-level, verbose way before attempting fancy shortcuts; remember to program in 'respond_to html and json' in every controller action where it is needed...oof.

### Day 4: January 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: worked on Hike class and prototype, fixed up comments prototype, worked out jQuery dependencies

**Thoughts** 
Today was less coding progress than I would have liked due to troubleshooting jQuery not working in the browser, but I finally got it to work, so success!  I also spent a lot of time reviewing an AJAX video to figure out how to render comments in a partial while also using AJAX.  Tomorrow I will try to implement what I learned and get it going.  I also learned how to capture the URL I need to get my first feature working (loading the user's hikes) so that is pretty big.

### Day 3: January 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Merged kickoff branch, solidified comment constructor and prototype in users.js, deleted all traces of turbolinks and unneeded gems, added better div class selectors for comments, sketched out how to show there are no comments (still in my notes.md, not sure how to implement yet), and hand-wrote how to load my comments...I just needed to wrap my head around it and have it to look at easily while I looked at my views.  I also created all my serializers and added the necessary associations.

**Thoughts** 
I had my 'project kickoff meeting,' which solidified my conceptualization of the project and its requirements.  I learned how to be better at tinkering around every step of the way with figuring out my jQuery, and how to display the JSON I'm after in the browser before using it to drill down using JS and jQuery.  I'm pumped!

### Day 2: January 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created my branchfor my 4th portfolio project, and started on the users.js file in addition to sketching out my strategy more deeply in my notes markdown doc.

**Thoughts** 
Today I did do some coding in JS, but mostly I continued to conceptualize how I will get my portfolio project to work with the requirements and drilled down with how to proceed with more specifics, in addition to creating a new branch 'kickoff' to be used for my kickoff meeting tomorrow.  I also spent A LOT of time reviewing JS basics and definitions that I couldn't immediately think of from memory by creating a JS notes file.

### Day 1: January 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created my repo for my 4th portfolio project, with all the necessary files.

**Thoughts** 
Today I learned how to successfully create a mirror repository on Github.  At first I (foolishly) thought it would be easier to make a new repo and copy and paste ^_^; but then I quickly realized that was ridiculous.  It's nice to feel like I'm getting a little more git-savvy.
