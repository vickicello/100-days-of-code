# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I GOT MY AJAX GET REQUESTS TO WORK, VIA HTML AND JSON!!!

**Thoughts** 
Again, a lot of troubleshooting today.  Takeaways: make sure you wrap your document.ready function around the entire js file; make sure you follow formatting conventions; code things out the low-level, verbose way before attempting fancy shortcuts; remember to program in 'respond_to html and json' in every controller action where it is needed...oof.

### Day 4: January 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: worked on Hike class and prototype, fixed up comments prototype, worked out jQuery dependencies

**Thoughts** 
Today was less coding progress than I would have liked due to troubleshooting jQuery not working in the browser, but I finally got it to work, so success!  I also spent a lot of time reviewing an AJAX video to figure out how to render comments in a partial while also using AJAX.  Tomorrow I will try to implement what I learned and get it going.  I also learned how to capture the URL I need to get my first feature working (loading the user's hikes) so that is pretty big.

### Day 3: January 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Merged kickoff branch, solidified comment constructor and prototype in users.js, deleted all traces of turbolinks and unneeded gems, added better div class selectors for comments, sketched out how to show there are no comments (still in my notes.md, not sure how to implement yet), and hand-wrote how to load my comments...I just needed to wrap my head around it and have it to look at easily while I looked at my views.  I also created all my serializers and added the necessary associations.

**Thoughts** 
I had my 'project kickoff meeting,' which solidified my conceptualization of the project and its requirements.  I learned how to be better at tinkering around every step of the way with figuring out my jQuery, and how to display the JSON I'm after in the browser before using it to drill down using JS and jQuery.  I'm pumped!

### Day 2: January 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created my branchfor my 4th portfolio project, and started on the users.js file in addition to sketching out my strategy more deeply in my notes markdown doc.

**Thoughts** 
Today I did do some coding in JS, but mostly I continued to conceptualize how I will get my portfolio project to work with the requirements and drilled down with how to proceed with more specifics, in addition to creating a new branch 'kickoff' to be used for my kickoff meeting tomorrow.  I also spent A LOT of time reviewing JS basics and definitions that I couldn't immediately think of from memory by creating a JS notes file.

### Day 1: January 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created my repo for my 4th portfolio project, with all the necessary files.

**Thoughts** 
Today I learned how to successfully create a mirror repository on Github.  At first I (foolishly) thought it would be easier to make a new repo and copy and paste ^_^; but then I quickly realized that was ridiculous.  It's nice to feel like I'm getting a little more git-savvy.
