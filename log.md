# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created my branchfor my 4th portfolio project, and started on the users.js file in addition to sketching out my strategy more deeply in my notes markdown doc.

**Thoughts** 
Today I did do some coding in JS, but mostly I continued to conceptualize how I will get my portfolio project to work with the requirements and drilled down with how to proceed with more specifics, in addition to creating a new branch 'kickoff' to be used for my kickoff meeting tomorrow.  I also spent A LOT of time reviewing JS basics and definitions that I couldn't immediately think of from memory by creating a JS notes file.

### Day 1: January 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created my repo for my 4th portfolio project, with all the necessary files.

**Thoughts** 
Today I learned how to successfully create a mirror repository on Github.  At first I (foolishly) thought it would be easier to make a new repo and copy and paste ^_^; but then I quickly realized that was ridiculous.  It's nice to feel like I'm getting a little more git-savvy.
