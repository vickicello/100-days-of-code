# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: January 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I got started on the React curriulum. I practiced setting up a package.json file, and installing an npm package or two and using their functionality to write new code.  I also read a lot about the principles of React and completed the first real React lab.

**Thoughts** 
I'm thinking I need a bit of outside help for my portfolio project, so I figured I'd start on the React curriculum today and come back to the project tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 10: January 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Today I got my Comment class working, and was able to successfully render comments using AJAX, as well as submit the form via AJAX.

**Thoughts** 
Another complicated day working on my project - I got some things to work and more requirements are satisfied, but still can't manage to get my hike show AJAX method to work.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my main.css file wouldn't load, either (I still can't figure it out!)  I might have to wait until next week to get some 1:1 help with these things since they seem to be rather specific to my project.

### Day 9: January 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Thought I would finish up the project today, but ended up not being able to solve the show details of hike feature...I definitely spent more than a few hours tinkering so I think I should try again with fresh eyes tomorrow.

**Thoughts** 
Sometimes a break is needed ... otherwise I am just going in circles...and sometimes there will be code obstacles that take more than a day to fix.

### Day 8: January 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Very good day, received form data through AJAX and display via AJAX (although a bit buggy still), and also got prototype function to work on my users show page.

**Thoughts** 
Thanks to a nice study session I was able to finally get my prototype function to work, and finally solidified how I will satisfy all project requirements.

### Day 7: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I finally figured out a workaround for making a link_to my comments partial (I just turned the comments into index.html.erb which is kind of cheating, but whatever!) and got some stuff appended to the hike show page.  I am sooo close to getting that feature to work.

**Thoughts** 
I made a dumb mistake that wouldn't allow my link helper to work (forgot to put in some text as a placeholder and a comma after that text)...it was nice to be able to eventually troubleshoot the problem myself without asking anybody or googling around, although it was a silly mistake!

### Day 6: January 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: did a lot of tinkering with hike next button, but in the end decided to knix in lieu of a more approachable option (just rendering comments).  I think I figured out how to render the comments form, either via partial or by creating a form in JS

**Thoughts** 
After a lot of internal debate, I decided to knix the 'next' button on my hike show page, it was too tricky for now.  Instead I will just focus on rendering comments and the comments form.

### Day 5: January 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I GOT MY AJAX GET REQUESTS TO WORK, VIA HTML AND JSON!!!

**Thoughts** 
Again, a lot of troubleshooting today.  Takeaways: make sure you wrap your document.ready function around the entire js file; make sure you follow formatting conventions; code things out the low-level, verbose way before attempting fancy shortcuts; remember to program in 'respond_to html and json' in every controller action where it is needed...oof.

### Day 4: January 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: worked on Hike class and prototype, fixed up comments prototype, worked out jQuery dependencies

**Thoughts** 
Today was less coding progress than I would have liked due to troubleshooting jQuery not working in the browser, but I finally got it to work, so success!  I also spent a lot of time reviewing an AJAX video to figure out how to render comments in a partial while also using AJAX.  Tomorrow I will try to implement what I learned and get it going.  I also learned how to capture the URL I need to get my first feature working (loading the user's hikes) so that is pretty big.

### Day 3: January 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Merged kickoff branch, solidified comment constructor and prototype in users.js, deleted all traces of turbolinks and unneeded gems, added better div class selectors for comments, sketched out how to show there are no comments (still in my notes.md, not sure how to implement yet), and hand-wrote how to load my comments...I just needed to wrap my head around it and have it to look at easily while I looked at my views.  I also created all my serializers and added the necessary associations.

**Thoughts** 
I had my 'project kickoff meeting,' which solidified my conceptualization of the project and its requirements.  I learned how to be better at tinkering around every step of the way with figuring out my jQuery, and how to display the JSON I'm after in the browser before using it to drill down using JS and jQuery.  I'm pumped!

### Day 2: January 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created my branchfor my 4th portfolio project, and started on the users.js file in addition to sketching out my strategy more deeply in my notes markdown doc.

**Thoughts** 
Today I did do some coding in JS, but mostly I continued to conceptualize how I will get my portfolio project to work with the requirements and drilled down with how to proceed with more specifics, in addition to creating a new branch 'kickoff' to be used for my kickoff meeting tomorrow.  I also spent A LOT of time reviewing JS basics and definitions that I couldn't immediately think of from memory by creating a JS notes file.

### Day 1: January 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created my repo for my 4th portfolio project, with all the necessary files.

**Thoughts** 
Today I learned how to successfully create a mirror repository on Github.  At first I (foolishly) thought it would be easier to make a new repo and copy and paste ^_^; but then I quickly realized that was ridiculous.  It's nice to feel like I'm getting a little more git-savvy.
